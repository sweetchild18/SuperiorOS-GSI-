Hello guys! Here, I SweetChild. Since ChonDoit has finished the development of SuperiorOS GSI Rom and the last release is 2025, January 23rd and only the last A14 build and EOL, there will probably be no further updates. Therefore, I will take over ChonDoit's work and start developing the SuperiorOS GSI roms myself. Note that I support both arm64 and a64 architectures. Here is the last absolute A14 release I have. A14 is now absolute EOL. Next we will already see SuperiorOS GSI rom based on A15.
